# Task 1: Text Preprocessing Operations

## Step 1: Create a Function Named `clean_text` for Text Preprocessing
The function performs:
- Lowercasing of text
- Removal of punctuation
- Elimination of numerical expressions

## Step 2: Apply the Function to All Texts in the Dataset
Apply the `clean_text` function to process all texts within the dataset.

## Step 3: Write a Function Named `remove_stopwords` to Remove Unimportant Words During Feature Extraction
Implement a function named `remove_stopwords` to remove non-essential words from the text.

## Step 4: Apply the Written Function to All Texts in the Dataset
Apply the `remove_stopwords` function to process all texts within the dataset.

## Step 5: Find and Remove Less Frequently Occurring Words (e.g., fewer than 1000 occurrences, fewer than 2000 occurrences)
Identify words in the text dataset that appear infrequently (e.g., fewer than 1000 occurrences) and remove them.

## Step 6: Tokenize the Texts and Observe the Results
Tokenize the processed texts into individual tokens (words) and observe the results.

## Step 7: Perform Lemmatization
Apply lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

# Task 2: Data Visualization

## Step 1: Calculate Term Frequencies in the Texts
Compute the frequencies of terms (words) in the texts.

## Step 2: Create a Barplot of Term Frequencies Found in the Previous Step
Generate a barplot to visualize the frequencies of terms identified in the previous step.

## Step 3: Visualize Words Using WordCloud
Create a WordCloud to visually represent the words based on their frequencies.

# Task 3: Writing All Steps as a Single Function

## Step 1: Conduct Text Preprocessing Operations
Perform text preprocessing tasks such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, and numerical expression elimination.

## Step 2: Integrate Visualization Operations as Arguments into the Function
Add visualization operations as arguments to the function.

## Step 3: Document the Function with a Docstring
Write a detailed docstring explaining the function's purpose, steps, and parameters.
